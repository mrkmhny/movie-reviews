## CSCA 5632 Final Project: Sentiment analysis in IMDB Movie Ratings database

### Introduction and Why?
Sentiment analysis is a staple project in the world of machine learning. It has numerous applications, including PR / customer service, training AI to detect user emotion, market research, stock market forcasting, and content moderation.  Of course, it's also a great opportunity to employ the unsupervised learning methods that we explored in this class and see how they perform.

### Data
The IMDB Movie Ratings database is a great resource for us, as it has 40,000 text-based reviews that are labeled with positive/negative, which we can use to check our accuracy.
